I am a fifth-year grad student starting in 2019. I grew up in Xi'an, China and finished my undergrad at Peking University. My current interest lies in low-dimensional electron systems (moir√© materials, quantum Hall systems, Luttinger liquid, etc.), where I apply theoretical and numerical tools to study the close interplay between strongly-correlated physics and topological phases of matter. I'm also interested in the formal aspects of symmetry, topology, and entanglement in many-body physics. Beyond academics, I enjoy classical music, hiking, and exploring my neighborhood.
