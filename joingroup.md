# How to Join

## Postdoctoral Scholars and Graduate Students
Graduate admissions are handled by the Physics department through the standard process; see the [department website](https://physics.berkeley.edu/academic/graduate-degree/graduate-admissions). Admitted applicants will be invited to visit the department in late March, early April. During the Open House, you can meet with Mike and current group members to learn about our work.

Interested postdocs should reach out to the group PI.
<!-- MIKE SHOULD EDIT THIS.
See members page for contact information. Interested graduate students and and postdoctoral scholars should reach out to the group PI.-->

## Undergraduate Students
Undergraduate students who are interested in getting involved in research in the group should fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/YtSB8uHwJTGNQvZcA) which includes an upload link for a transcript. We will do our best to match you with a suitable project and mentor, but we expect to have far more applications than available projects. The deadline to apply for Spring/Summer 2023 is **Monday, February 13th, 2023**. After this, we will review applications and contact applicants in early March. 

Students should also consult the department [page](https://physics.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-degree/research-opportunities) on research opportunities, funding sources, and deadlines. We would especially like to highlight the [Pi2 Summer Scholars Program](https://physics.berkeley.edu/Physics-Innovators-Initiative-Pi2-2023-Summer-Scholars-Program-Information); **applications also due 02/13/2023**. The Zaletel group is offering a project, "Quantum geometry and the fractional quantum Hall effect", through the Pi2 Summer Scholars Program. **If you are interested in this project, you must separately apply through the Pi2 website.** The department handles the applications for this program separately. 

We also recommend the Berkeley Physics Undergraduate Research Scholars Program (BPURS), [Berkeley Connect](https://www.berkeleyconnect.berkeley.edu/), [Compass Project](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~comproj/), and [MPS scholars](https://mpsscholars.berkeley.edu/) for semesterly support.
