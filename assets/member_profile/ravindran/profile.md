I am a fourth year undergraduate at Berkeley majoring in math and physics. I am currently working on tensor network methods for critical systems but am also interested in a wide range of topics spanning condensed matter theory, generalized symmetries and quantum information. Outside of academics I like to play the violin, read science fiction and go on hikes.
