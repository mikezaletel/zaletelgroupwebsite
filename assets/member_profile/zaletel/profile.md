My research focuses on theoretical condensed matter physics and its intersection with quantum information and computational approaches. I'm interested in developing new computational methods for attacking the quantum many-body problem, finding conceptually interesting problems to apply them to, and working closely with experimentalists to see whether anything we're saying actually makes sense. Most recently I've beening thinking about fractional quantum Hall physics, non-Abelian anyons, and their potential for quantum computing; strongly-correlated phenomena in "moire materials" like twisted bilayer graphene; frustrated magnetism and spin liquids; formal aspects of topological order and their interplay with symmetry; and exploring many-body physics in AMO systems and near-term quantum computers. I received a degree in steer wrangling from Deep Springs College, an AB with highest honors in physics from Harvard University in 2009, and a Ph.D. at Berkeley working with Professor Joel Moore. In 2018, after a postdoctoral position in at Microsoft Research Station Q and a year as a faculty member at Princeton, I returned to Berkeley as the Thomas and Alison Schneider Chair in Physics. I was happy to receive the  2018 McMillan Award, 2020 Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship, and the 2022 DOE Career Award.
