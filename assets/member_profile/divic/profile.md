I'm a grad student interested in quantum many-body systems in two dimensions. Recently, I have been trying to understand (1) the behavior of interacting electrons in partially-filled topological bands, and (2) the universal non-equilibrium dynamics of bosons coupled to a noisy environment. Prior to joining Mike's group, I did my undergrad in my hometown, Toronto, Canada.
