My research interests span a broad range of strongly-correlated phenomena in quantum many-body systems, and their associated numerical methods. At the moment, I am exploring some exciting problems in non-Hermitian systems, symmetry protected topology, Floquet many-body localization, quantum many-body scars, and the fractional quantum Hall effect. Prior to Berkeley, I was a postdoc at UCLA and the University of Zurich, and before that, a graduate student at the University of Cambridge.
