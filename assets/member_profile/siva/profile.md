I am a sixth year graduate student working on tensor network methods, multipartite entanglement in condensed matter systems, quantum information theory, and experiments in superconducting circuits. Outside of research, I enjoy biking, camping, cooking, and playing guitar. Prior to graduate school, I received my bachelor's degree at Caltech and worked at DE Shaw Research.
