I am a fourth-year grad student starting at 2019. I am interested in various topological phases of matter (such as topological insulators and quantum Hall systems), which embody both the elegance of mathematical structure and the emergent diversity of physics at the low-energy scale. I'm recently working on using numerical tools to explore the novel phases in twisted bilayer graphene and other moire materials. As for my trajectory of life, I grew up in Xi'an, China and finished my undergrad in Peking University. I enjoy hiking into nature and discovering new neighborhoods on my bike.
